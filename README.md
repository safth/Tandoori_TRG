# Tandoori_TRG
Analyze spectras and yields the electron Temperature and the electron density with high accuracy for plasma with trace of Neon, Argon, Krypton, Xenon. The software work by minimizing the ratio between emission line and modelled emission line from cross-section for every Te between 0.05 and 15eV. Stepwise excitation is taken into account as well â€¦
