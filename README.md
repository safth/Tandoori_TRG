# Tandoori_TRG
Analyze spectras and yields the electron Temperature and the electron density with high accuracy for plasma with trace of Neon, Argon, Krypton, Xenon. The software work by minimizing the ratio between emission line and simulated emission line from cross-section for every Te between 0.05 and 15eV.

The above sketch represent all the collisionnal and radiative processes involved to solve the densitiies of the 2p levels of all rare gases.
